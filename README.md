# Cat Game — Unity Project

This is a 2D Unity game I’m building as part of my self-challenge to create one game a day (or every few days) to grow as a developer and learn better workflows.

## 🎮 About the Game

This project is designed around the idea of making an interactive and visually satisfying experience *for cats*. It features:

- 🐦 A flapping bluebird animated from hand-selected sprite frames
- 🐟 Objects like fish and roaches that move across the screen and can be clicked on
- 🎨 A custom background and color palette optimized for how cats see the world (blues, yellows, contrast)

## 💡 Goals

- Practice Unity animation and sprite setup
- Improve 2D game structure and asset organization
- Understand visual design from a cat's perspective
- Work in small daily game loops for consistent growth

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Unity (2D project)
- GitHub Desktop for version control
- Transparent PNGs + custom sprites
- Animator for looping bird animations

## 🌱 Current Status

This game is in development, with key pieces like:
- Bird animation and movement ✅
- Click interaction scripts ✅
- Cat-optimized visuals and layout ✅

Future plans may include sound effects, sparkle interactions, and more moving critters.
